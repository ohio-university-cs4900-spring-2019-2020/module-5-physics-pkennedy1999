Tried for multiple hours but could not get Linux VM on my Mac to build the module. Just did project on Linux machines
in the lab hoping the sound would just work if you tested it because computers in lab do not have speakers and headphone
jacks do not work. I know that all of my code is correct with playing the 2D sound, the 3D sound, and the echo sound
effect for the 3D sound but I was not able to link everything correctly because I just kept getting compiler
errors with the scope of createIrrKlangDevice(). I should be able to complete next assignment with ease if it does not include
audio which I do not think that it is.
